# BIG PICTURE: What languages are we learning and why? 

### A look at the big things taught by GA's WDI

## JavaScript

  This is the only language that runs in a Brower. It's Object Oriented, but a bit weird. It also can run in Node, and be used for backend applications. 
 
## JavaScript + Node

  This allows us to build back end applications that talk to databases using JavaScript. Why? It's fast, it's popular, and it's nice to be able to build a full stack app in one language. 
  
## Bash

  This is the language of our machine. It's what your OS uses behind the scenes to open a file when you double click it. You can use it to interact with your machine via the terminal. It is very practical, but it is also a very powerful programming language in its own right! We use it to navigate through folders with `cd`, create things with `mkdir` and `touch`, interact with `git`, `npm` and other tools, and more. It can also be used for automating tasks on your machine, making web requests with `curl` and much more!
  
## HTML

This is not a programming language, but a templating language for creating the structure of web pages

## CSS

Also not a programming language, but a domain specific declarative language. Meaning it is for the specific domain of styling web pages, and it is used to declare things like "This should be red!"

## jQuery

jQuery is a JavaScript library for DOM manipulation. 

## React JS

React is a hugely popular, powerful, cool way to create SPA's. It is a JavaScript *framework*, which means it's a library that not only gives you helper methods like jQuery does, but it also gives you specific ways to structure your application. 

# Second Language Option

Following the React unit, we will be learning a second language.  You will have the opportunity choose one of the three languages that will be taught globally.  Learning a second language is a great opportunity to not only see new ways to look at things, but it will help reinforce concepts that we have already taught you in a new light.  All of these second languages will culminate in a four project creating an API in the respective language. Each language will be learned by learning the basic datatypes and by building an MVC application (analogous to how we used Express in Unit 2).  

- Over the next few days think about what you would like to do, we will send out a survey Friday gathering your choices.  

## The options:

1.  **Python, (Flask - Server Framework)** - **Jim** Globally 
 * Very popular
 * Easy to get up and running fast
 * Python skills are used all over the place, especially in the emerging fields of Data Science and AI. 

2. **Ruby, (Sinatra - Server Framework, Rails if time)** - **Reuben** Globally
 * Easy to get up and running
 * Language famous for being very programmer-friendly: very clear syntax: every thing is truly an OBJECT! 
 * Rails is a very popular framework, known for being useful for rapidly building a prototype of an app concept. 
 * Therefore it is great for freelancing and beginning to midlevel size startups/companies (for example, Reverb in Chicago is a Rails shop).  

3. **Java, (Spring - Server Framework)** - **Ryan** Globally - 
 * Lower Level language, (thats means alot more syntax and responsibilities)  
 * Very Popular in the market, lots of code bases out there are in Java, since it is an older language.  
 * Very popular in corporate an huge enterpise software companies.  
 * Also is very popular in Android development if that is something you fancy.  
 * Note: (Advanced Students Only, Have to complete a test to participate.)
