# Ice Breakers:

#### Each of us will share the following:

1. Your name
2. Where you grew up, and something cool that most people might not know about that place. 
3. Something you think you will have to work on to succeed in this course.
4. Something positive you bring to the table in this class.
5. What you would like to get out of this class.
## Activity before we get started:
#### Write a letter to your future (graduated self).
  * Students will write a letter stating what they would like to get out of the course.
  * Once you write your letter, put it in a sealed envelope to give to your instructor. 
  * We'll give them back to you at graduation!

## OK! Let's get a jump on our first lesson!
